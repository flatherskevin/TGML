		%	06/06/2017 changed check_file_contents() to validate_file()
		%	06/06/2017 validate_file() now takes in optional parameters
				extension_check and tag_check to define what type of
				validation should be done
		+	06/06/2017 static property SUPPORTED_CHILDREN tuple that declares all
				the child tag types that are supported by a Tgml element
		+	06/06/2017 validate_element(), which is similar to validate_file() but
				for a Tgml element instead of a file
		+	06/06/2017 class and file name change TGML => Tgml
		%	06/07/2017 read_tgml_file(), on failure, no long returns etree Tgml element.
				Instead it's now set to self.element
		%	06/07/2017 fixed __init__() read_tgml_file() mehtod does not exist
		%	06/07/2017 __init__() has more options for object creation
